    "review": "Quicklets: Your Reading Sidekick! \n<br />\n<br />ABOUT THE BOOK \n<br />\n<br />At first glance, my new job seemed similar to many others in Silicon Valley: on the verge of a merger, executives far removed from their customers, and too many projects to be completed in too little time. Everyone worked late into the evening, and there was always a server down, an email problem, or an executive who a new implemented immediately. \n<br />\n<br />I soon discovered that my team's supervisor was different. He wanted us to learn. Each week he suggested a new YouTube video or adult education class, and he talked about what he was reading. He already knew about the Singing Scientist, but he was not prepared for what he discovered in her book, My Stroke of Insight. Nor were we prepared for his enthusiasm in our staff meeting that Monday morning when he declared that her book had changed his life. \n<br />\n<br />MEET THE AUTHOR \n<br />\n<br />S. A. Robbins received his MFA in Writing (Warren Wilson College) in 1986, and has published numerous poems and stories, as well as many technical essays. His collection of short stories about Silicon Valley, The System is a Mirror, was published by John Wiley & Sons in 2007. \n<br />\n<br />EXCERPT FROM THE BOOK \n<br />\n<br />Dr. Taylor's book, My Stroke of Insight, is her personal recounting of that life-changing morning, remarkable in its detail because, as a neuroscientist, she understood what was happening to her as it was happening. Beginning with a brief outline of her life before her massive stroke (and two short chapters on the basic functions of the brain so that the reader can appreciate the coming narrative), Taylor describes in poignant and unforgettable detail the morning of the stroke, the first critical days after surgery, and the complicated, very personal eight-year struggle to regain her abilities to talk, function \u201cnormally\u201d in society, and remember her friends and identity.  \n<br />\n<br />The quintessential lessons in the book, however, revolve around her profound understanding of her damaged brain, its capacity for repair, and most importantly, her spiritual/mystical moments at the peak of her incapacity. Insight into those moments offers the reader a new perspective about how we think, who we are, and what we can be. \n<br />\n<br />CHAPTER OUTLINE\n<br />\n<br />Quicklet on Jill Bolte Taylor\u2019s My Stroke of Insight\n<br />  + Introduction\n<br />  + About Jill Bolte Taylor\n<br />  + About My Stroke of Insight\n<br />  + Chapter Summaries and Analysis\n<br />  + About the Brain\n<br />  + ...and much more\n<br />\n<br />Buy a copy to keep reading!",

    "review": "An astonishing new science called \"neuroplasticity\" is overthrowing the centuries-old notion that the human brain is immutable. In this revolutionary look at the brain, psychiatrist and psychoanalyst Norman Doidge, M.D., provides an introduction to both the brilliant scientists championing neuroplasticity and the people whose lives they've transformed. From stroke patients learning to speak again to the remarkable case of a woman born with half a brain that rewired itself to work as a whole, <em>The Brain That Changes Itself</em> will permanently alter the way we look at our brains, human nature, and human potential.",
